# 🤖 Agentic Workflow System

## Overview

The Agentic Workflow System adds autonomous capabilities to the workflow engine, enabling it to learn, adapt, and optimize automatically.

## ✨ Implemented Features

### 1. ✅ Autonomous Workflow Composition

**What it does:** Generates complete workflows from high-level goals or natural language descriptions.

**Components:**
- `WorkflowComposer`: Selects and chains appropriate nodes based on task requirements
- Natural language parser: Converts text descriptions to structured goals
- Hardware-aware node selection: Chooses optimal backends (GPU/NPU/CPU)

**Usage:**

```python
from workflow_agent import AgenticWorkflowSystem, WorkflowGoal

agent = AgenticWorkflowSystem()

# Method 1: Structured goal
goal = WorkflowGoal(
    task="object_detection",
    input_type="sample_video.mp4",
    output_type="display",
    performance_target=20.0,
    hardware_preference="auto"
)

workflow = agent.create_workflow_from_goal(goal)
```

```bash
# Method 2: Natural language (CLI)
uv run python agentic_integration.py "Detect objects in video with good performance"
uv run python agentic_integration.py "Process webcam for real-time detection"
uv run python agentic_integration.py "Analyze video, prioritize accuracy over speed"
```

**Auto-generated workflow includes:**
- Hardware detection
- Model download
- Optimal processing pipeline (granular/monolithic/fast)
- Performance statistics
- Pre-optimized parameters from historical data

---

### 2. ✅ Self-Optimization System

**What it does:** Monitors performance and suggests optimal parameters based on execution history.

**Components:**
- `PerformanceOptimizer`: Tracks all executions in `performance_history.json`
- Parameter suggestion engine: Recommends best settings for target FPS
- Trend analyzer: Identifies performance improvements/degradations

**How it works:**

1. **Records every execution** with:
   - Performance metrics (FPS, latency)
   - Parameters used (conf_threshold, iou_threshold, etc.)
   - Hardware configuration
   - Success/failure status

2. **Suggests parameters** by:
   - Finding similar historical runs
   - Filtering by performance targets
   - Recommending best-performing configurations

3. **Analyzes trends**:
   - Recent vs historical performance
   - Success rate tracking
   - Performance stability metrics

**Example:**

```python
optimizer = agent.optimizer

# Get suggested parameters for 20 FPS target
params = optimizer.suggest_parameters(workflow_type="granular", target_fps=20.0)
# Returns: {'conf_threshold': 0.25, 'iou_threshold': 0.7, ...}

# Analyze performance trend
trend = optimizer.analyze_performance_trend("granular", window=10)
# Returns: {'trend': 'improving', 'avg_fps': 19.2, 'min_fps': 18.1, 'max_fps': 20.3}
```

---

### 3. ✅ Adaptive Pipeline Selection

**What it does:** Chooses optimal execution strategy based on requirements and constraints.

**Components:**
- `PipelineSelector`: Decision engine for strategy selection
- Strategy profiles: Performance characteristics of each approach
- Recommendation system: Suggests best strategy for use case

**Available Strategies:**

| Strategy | Typical FPS | Composability | Flexibility | Best For |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Granular** | ~19 FPS | High | High | Development, testing, custom pipelines |
| **Monolithic** | ~25 FPS | Low | Low | Production, maximum performance |
| **Fast Pipeline** | ~22 FPS | Medium | Low | Balance of performance & maintainability |

**Selection Logic:**

```python
selector = agent.selector

# Auto-select based on requirements
strategy, config = selector.select_strategy(
    fps_target=20.0,              # Need 20 FPS
    flexibility_needed=True,       # Need to customize
    hardware_available={'gpu': True}
)

print(f"Selected: {strategy}")
# Output: "Selected: granular" (high FPS target but needs flexibility)
```

**Decision Rules:**
- FPS target > 23 + need flexibility → **fast_pipeline**
- FPS target > 23 + don't need flexibility → **monolithic**
- Flexibility needed → **granular**
- Default → **fast_pipeline** (balanced)

---

### 4. ✅ Learning from Execution

**What it does:** Builds knowledge base from execution history and provides actionable insights.

**Components:**
- `ExecutionLearner`: Knowledge base builder and insight generator
- Pattern recognition: Identifies what configurations work best
- Recommendation engine: Suggests optimizations based on patterns

**Knowledge Base Includes:**
- Per-workflow-type statistics
- Best-performing configurations
- Success rate tracking
- Hardware-specific profiles

**Example Insights:**

```python
learner = agent.learner
learner.build_knowledge_base()

insights = learner.get_insights()
```

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "total_executions": 15,
  "workflow_types": ["granular", "monolithic"],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "type": "granular",
      "issue": "low_fps",
      "suggestion": "Consider using fast_pipeline or monolithic approach"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Auto-Suggestions:**

The system automatically suggests optimizations:

```python
suggestions = learner.suggest_optimizations(current_fps=16.5, workflow_type="granular")
```

**Example Suggestions:**
- ✅ "Your FPS (16.5) is below historical best (19.3). Try the best known configuration."
- ✅ "Best config: {'conf_threshold': 0.25, 'iou_threshold': 0.7}"
- ✅ "Consider using SILENT log level for atomic nodes"
- ✅ "Try reducing conf_threshold to 0.3 or higher"
- ✅ "Consider switching to fast_pipeline for better performance"

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Generate Workflow from Natural Language

```bash
# Generate and save workflow
uv run python agentic_integration.py "Detect objects in video with good performance"

# This creates: workflows/nl_generated_workflow.json
```

### 2. Execute Workflow with Learning

```bash
# Run workflow with agentic monitoring
uv run python agentic_integration.py workflows/granular_video_detection_mp4.json
```

The system will:
- ✅ Execute the workflow normally
- ✅ Record performance metrics
- ✅ Analyze results
- ✅ Provide optimization suggestions
- ✅ Update knowledge base

### 3. Programmatic Usage

```python
from agentic_integration import AgenticWorkflowEngine, create_workflow_from_natural_language
import json

# Option 1: Execute existing workflow with learning
with open('workflows/my_workflow.json', 'r') as f:
    workflow_data = json.load(f)

engine = AgenticWorkflowEngine(workflow_data, enable_learning=True)
results = engine.execute()

# Option 2: Generate and execute from natural language
workflow = create_workflow_from_natural_language(
    "Process webcam for real-time object detection"
)

with open('my_generated_workflow.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(workflow, f, indent=2)

# Execute it
engine = AgenticWorkflowEngine(workflow, enable_learning=True)
results = engine.execute()
```

---

## 📊 Performance History

The system maintains a persistent history in `performance_history.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-29T15:24:22.537715",
    "workflow_name": "Granular MP4 Video Detection",
    "workflow_type": "granular",
    "parameters": {
      "conf_threshold": 0.25,
      "iou_threshold": 0.7
    },
    "hardware": {
      "gpu": true,
      "npu": false,
      "cpu": true
    },
    "performance": {
      "fps": 19.3,
      "latency_ms": 53.2
    },
    "success": true
  }
]
```

**This data powers:**

## 🧠 How Learning Works

### Phase 1: Execution Recording

Every workflow execution is automatically recorded:

```python
record = ExecutionRecord(
    timestamp=datetime.now().isoformat(),
    workflow_name="My Workflow",
    workflow_type="granular",
    parameters={...},
    hardware={...},
    performance={'fps': 19.3, 'latency_ms': 52.1},
    success=True
)
```

### Phase 2: Knowledge Base Building

Periodic analysis builds profiles:

```python
knowledge_base = {
    "granular": {
        "executions": 10,
        "avg_fps": 19.2,
        "best_fps": 20.3,
        "success_rate": 1.0,
        "best_config": {...}
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Recommendation Generation

System generates insights:

```python
if current_fps < historical_best * 0.8:
    suggest("Try the best known configuration")

if fps < 15:
    suggest("Enable SILENT mode for better performance")

if workflow_type == "granular" and fps < 20:
    suggest("Consider fast_pipeline or monolithic")
```

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement

Over time, the system:
- ✅ Learns which configurations work best on your hardware
- ✅ Adapts recommendations to your specific use cases
- ✅ Identifies performance regressions
- ✅ Suggests when to switch strategies

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Strategy Selection

```python
from workflow_agent import PipelineSelector

selector = PipelineSelector()

strategy, config = selector.select_strategy(
    fps_target=25.0,           # Need 25 FPS
    flexibility_needed=False,  # Don't need customization
    hardware_available={'gpu': True, 'npu': True}
)

# Will select: "monolithic" for maximum performance
```

### Manual Parameter Tuning

```python
from workflow_agent import PerformanceOptimizer

optimizer = PerformanceOptimizer()

# Get best parameters for specific conditions
params = optimizer.suggest_parameters(
    workflow_type="granular",
    target_fps=20.0
)

# Use these in your workflow
my_workflow['nodes'][0]['inputs'].update(params)
```

### Trend Monitoring

```python
# Monitor recent performance
trend = optimizer.analyze_performance_trend(
    workflow_type="granular",
    window=10  # Last 10 executions
)

if trend['trend'] == 'declining':
    print("⚠️ Performance is degrading!")
    print(f"Was: {trend['max_fps']} FPS")
    print(f"Now: {trend['avg_fps']} FPS")
```
